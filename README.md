## A newsletter from space, tailored to you

You love astronomy, astrophysics and space science in general?

You could watch youtube videos talking about it for hours (and you do)?

You then complain that it takes too much time to keep up with this field?

You can subscribe to it [here](http://eepurl.com/iCIUtc).
You can also easily unsubscibe if you don't want it anymore.
